# Games
Some games I started to program but never finished. Feel free to use what you need.

## [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

#### Rust
using gdnative-bindings from [Godot-Rust](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust) \

#### C++
never got to do more than the C++ setup so not much to see here


## [Unity](https://unity.com/de)
#### C#
nothing finished, just some experiments:
- some hex generation scripts
- simple stuff like
 - pathfinding
 - camera movement
- etc.
